# tf_modules_tests

## Purpose

I want to build out terraform modules for code re-use on projects I'm writing/deploying

without including the tests I write to test said modules.

## Usage

- To pull down everything use:
'''
git submodule update --init --recursive
'''

- To run a particular test:

  enter the *tests/{module}* directory of your choice.
  
  Be warned, most modules require additional configuration.
  
  This can be found inside a per module readme.
